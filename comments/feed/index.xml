					<description><![CDATA[When talking bigtech with friends my biggest complaint is &#039;why can&#039;t I control the algorithms... give me 3 sliders with appropriate choice levels and i&#039;ll do it meself&#039;..

You&#039;re clearly way above my tech grade, however i recognise a good idea.

You&#039;ve got the 3slide thing going..
please make a general versatile 3slider algo app thingy thats appliable to different choices plugins?? or everhow it can be .. I know I want it
I&#039;m only here cuz i&#039;m thinking of using scuttlebut and researching a bit.. didn&#039;t expect to see an article so mirroring my wishes.. the trust implementation is major issues. I suspect you&#039;re on to it and it&#039;s in the soup somewhere, look forward to it.]]></description>

Yeah!! This idea is great... I&#039;d like to test it in real condition by using a mix of scuttlebut &#038; ipfs

					<description><![CDATA[I have been thinking for quite a while that this method of &#039;following&#039; other moderators is the best solution to the trust problems in federated or decentralized systems.  Decoupling this from your traditional &#039;moderation&#039; means the opportunity for a truly free expression, and yet still a quality experience.  One point that I belive is very important is feedback.  If you are &#039;added to someone&#039;s mod list&#039; you shpuld be notified, and have the opportunity to respond to that event, such that on the moderator&#039;s profile there is a record of moderation evens AND a listing of responses from those being moderated by that user, in order to show the history of moderation and help a user decide whether to subscribe to this moderator.

The next step would be creation of &#039;moderation coallitions&#039; which have a voting system within them and act as a single moderator who can be followed, in essence giving benefits of both community moderation and voluntary mod subscription.

Id love to talk more abt this!]]></description>
