<p>Modern day social media is crippling our collective creativity. It has constraints we cannot see but intuitively feel. We&#8217;re allowed to post what we like within the confines of the feed and controls of the website, but are we actually free?</p>



<p>Noam Chomsky, a leading intellectual thinking, foretold:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum&#8230;.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Social networks have a lot of problems: from controlling data, to spreading misinformation, to prioritizing profit over users. You&#8217;ve heard these arguments before, so they won&#8217;t be covered today. Instead let&#8217;s discuss a problem gone unnoticed and unsaid: <strong>Our creative freedom is being destroyed by lack of control over our experiences on these platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Have you noticed how most social content is from the here and now, an echo of the daily news? Rarely is there discourse on topics that were important weeks ago, let alone months or years ago. Our discourse is limited by these platforms and few realize it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We&#8217;re made to believe we are free to share anything and it will live and die on its own merit. You may think it&#8217;s just you, that because you posted something foreign to the weekly news cycle, people didn&#8217;t enjoy it. Some people did, some loved your content, but the masses didn&#8217;t, and they control the conversation. Stories live and die by their overall popularity, not how significant they are to individual users. </p>



<p>Social media companies amplify the conversations of the day because those conversations keep the average user hooked more than your interesting, unique content did. You&#8217;re posting to the perfectly manicured garden they give you. If you attempt to introduce content unfit for the garden it will be buried. It didn&#8217;t help the garden have mass appeal, and thus didn&#8217;t belong.</p>



<p>This is merely the constraints of an algorithmically determined feed. There&#8217;s also hidden constraints in the walls of these products. Why must every Facebook user have the exact same layout with the same event notifications, marketplace link perfectly positioned to draw your attention, the same endlessly scrolling feed. They chose this design because they believe it&#8217;s &#8220;optimal&#8221;, their split tests conclusively proved so. But is an averagely optimal experience really what everyone needs?</p>



<p>What if instead of living in perfectly designed gardens, we could explore a social forest?</p>



<p>Social media is like <a href="https://keukenhof.nl/en/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keukenhof</a>, a famously beautiful garden in the Netherlands, with flowers in full bloom, trees perfectly trimmed, and not a snail in sight.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/N7cgpnqW8tWe8Zl2gDfWah7Uz1DqC_-EH44S8dE1yGnfSGsBisJ_N-4HO8F6Ulnm9PYuDJMGy0Y-WjN-ZCyQ8k7zlmMJErTR5sevv1GjpATiYV2vUVK85NyOriPAtvaLyli0o9il" alt=""/></figure>



<p>What if social media was a forest instead? A place where we could see the mushrooms, bugs feasting on the decaying trees, moss growing along the riverbank. It wouldn&#8217;t be as safe and sanitary, but it&#8217;s much more fascinating and diverse.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MU4sNYoEeF40POXhp5QTIyddX2SaHz6dU9PMgPduUYBAXQHBRF2g7zbWAQO0CJfWQau_XnWcPuwPstObF0VISUdbdrbHVB4rBpJCeotHlcWj_dHAaG24HVK1zcWjm-0F53sfelQe" alt=""/><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@the_bracketeer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hendrik Cornelissen</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Keukenhof is nice, but do you really want to live there forever? Is it the only place you&#8217;d ever want to visit?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if we didn&#8217;t have just one online forest to explore, but many different environments, from forests, to mountains, to swampy marshes, each with their own unique experiences and benefits.</p>



<p>Prior to Social Media the web had diversity, do you remember the GeoCities time? Links could be anywhere, fonts could be anything, websites had endlessly repeating GIF backgrounds. The web was a wonderland of strange and beautiful things to explore. People posted their thoughts on any design they liked and if you wanted to put yourself out there you could do it in any way you desire. </p>



<p>What if we weren&#8217;t forced into using the same social client? What if we weren&#8217;t forced to use their feed sorting algorithm? What if we could use any one of hundreds of open source feed sorting algorithms, or make our own, and still participate in the same network?</p>



<p>This is the promise of Open Source, Decentralized Social networks. They&#8217;re social networks anyone can take part in, and choose how they experience the network. The underlying protocol is the same, but the clients everyone uses are different.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SdsT4iAHUC88JMkLtLhxMXCiITv7t4JAeMPagNJBJJKGLUxtGWsVRYwkVbnI8MsJN8QwraC3oEHtVemsTZDbdTIPYs7PEGNHltMKFZva5Rj1Dqqvc0sMi94UJR-3C_6gk872X3XL" alt=""/><figcaption>Desktop clients: <a href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patchwork</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fraction/oasis" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oasis</a>. Mobile clients: <a href="https://planetary.social/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Planetary</a> and <a href="https://www.manyver.se/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Manyverse</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>These clients are all real and usable today, and all connect to the same peer to peer network. You and your friends could be using 4 totally different apps but still talk to each other, post images and organize meetups together through them. They&#8217;re not as feature rich as Facebook or Instagram but with time they can get there. </p>



<p>There are a number of people writing about this issue, tackling it from different angles. They all point to the same conclusion: If we want a bright social future, we must free it from centralized corporate control.</p>



<p>Why does this make sense now? Because we have the technology to make it possible. When Facebook began in 2005 computers were less than 1/100th as powerful as today&#8217;s. It wasn&#8217;t possible to build a decentralized social network because someone needed to pay for the servers to hold and distribute the information everyone was sharing. As computing power doubles roughly every two years (and has been doing so for the last 75 years) we now have more than enough space and power to build networks that run on our personal devices.</p>



<p>Through a series of articles first analyzing the problem, why the answer must be open source and decentralized, and finally the solution. I&#8217;ll walk you through explaining why this is such an important topic and why it must be done to unlock maximum creativity from humanity.</p>



<h2><a href="https://staltz.com/reinvent-the-social-web.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reinvent The Social Web</a></h2>



<p>André Staltz is a passionate believer in a new decentralized social web, and he eloquently lays out what&#8217;s wrong with existing social media.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In the beginning, the web was created as the hypertext — a graph where the documents are the nodes and the hyperlinks are the edges. It made a lot of sense for academics, at a time when the desktop had the best user experience. Writing HTML was not that bad for academics already comfortable with markup like LaTeX for papers.</p><p>The social web emphasizes posts, which can be short messages or pictures. They don’t need to be authored in markup like HTML.</p><p>The user experience is comfortable for everyone. The UX of content creation is important, because it means the social web grows faster than hypertext, and eventually will outgrow the web itself. I believe we may have passed this point already.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sounds great right? Easier content creation means more content from everyone, we can all participate instead of just a handful of designers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We could embrace this new era and just forget hypertext. But the problem is that the social web is made out of a handful of closed platforms, whereas the web is open.</p><p>On the closed social web, there are many problems. We lack freedom, innovation, trust, respect, and transparency.</p><p>Innovation on these platforms is dying. Third party apps are taken down, and there is little diversity in the UI choices. We become passive consumers of UX decisions by the tech giants, and we don’t have any control over newsfeed algorithms.</p><p>We’ve gotten used to closed platforms making decisions for us, but there’s a huge opportunity for innovation that’s unlocked in an open protocol.</p></blockquote>



<p>These platforms provide a simple way to create content, but only if you stay inside their perfectly manicured garden.</p>



<p>André has a solution to this problem,&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>So, what if we take this idea that works, and reinvent it with a coherent and open protocol?</p><p><a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scuttlebutt</a> is a peer-to-peer open protocol for social networks. It was created in 2014 by Dominic Tarr and other NodeJS hackers. I joined in 2016.</p></blockquote>



<p>We&#8217;ll touch on Scuttlebutt more soon in this article, if you want to know more about it, check out his post.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><a href="https://blog.neocities.org/blog/2013/05/28/making-the-web-fun-again.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neocities, Making the Web fun again</a></h2>



<p>Now we get to the core problem of blandness in social networks.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When Yahoo shut down GeoCities, they did much more than delete a bunch of obnoxious dancing baby GIFs and Limp Bizkit MIDI files. <strong>They deleted the ability for people (both old and new to the web) to easily create web sites, and be in complete control of the content and presentation they provide to their audience.</strong></p><p>Sure, some of the old sites weren’t “great”. But they were fun, and quirky, and interesting. We used to call it “surfing” the web, and that was actually a good way to describe it. There was a certain adventure to the activity &#8211; a fun and excitement in exploring the unknown.</p><p>Go to a Facebook profile, and ponder what we have now. Instead of having adventures into the great unknowns of the web, we instead now spend most of our time on social networks: boring, suburban gated communities, where everybody’s “profile” looks exactly the same, and presents exactly the same content, in the same arrangement. Rarely do we create things on these networks; Instead, we consume, and report on our consumption. <strong>The uniformity and blandness rival something out of a Soviet bloc residential apartments corridor.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>The other core problem of social media is most people have their real identities tied to the network, so you can&#8217;t talk about anything too taboo or provocative, as he continues:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>And when you don’t have to attach your real identity to everything you do, it still doesn’t matter how old you are, what you look like, or what your social class is</p></blockquote>



<p>Neocities is somewhat solving this creativity problem, and I love that it exists, but it&#8217;s not a social media platform.</p>



<h2><a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech</a></h2>



<p>One of the core problems of social networks is they&#8217;re all owned by massive corporations that must return profits to shareholders. Even if alternative networks are created they will need to generate a profit to survive, which causes them to focus on the keukenhof experience, instead of letting the forest grow unwieldy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These corporations have all the incentives to make their social network closed off to outside competition, lest they lose users to them. As they grow they become more insular to protect what they&#8217;ve built.</p>



<p>The solution is not another social network with some additional customization, the solution is a decentralized protocol that hundreds of social networks and social clients can connect to, and use to interact with each other. This gives everyone the freedom to choose the platform they want to be a part of, to choose the UI they love. If any of these platforms turn evil you can easily take your data and leave to a better platform, without having to bring all your friends with you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Moving to a world where protocols and not proprietary platforms dominate would solve many issues currently facing the internet today. Rather than relying on a few giant platforms to police speech online, there could be widespread competition, in which anyone could design their own interfaces, filters, and additional services, allowing whichever ones work best to succeed, without having to resort to outright censorship for certain voices.</p><p>At the same time, it would likely lead to new, more innovative features as well as better end-user control over their own data. Finally, it could help usher in a series of new business models that don’t focus exclusively on monetizing user data.</p></blockquote>



<p>He continues, the best analogy for how social networks should function is like email. We can all use different email providers and yet still communicate with each other. Why don&#8217;t social protocols work in the same way?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>However, because of these open standards, there is a great deal of flexibility. A user can use a non-Gmail email address within the Gmail interface. Or he or she can use a Gmail account with an entirely different client, such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail.</p><p>On top of that, it’s possible to create new interfaces on top of Gmail itself, such as with a Chrome extension.</p><p>This setup has many advantages for the end user. Even if one platform—like Gmail—becomes much more popular in the marketplace, the costs of switching are much lower. If a user does not like how Gmail handles certain features or is concerned about Google’s privacy practices, switching to a different platform is much easier, and the user does not lose access to all of his or her old contacts or the ability to email anyone else (even those contacts that remain Gmail users).</p><p>Notice that this flexibility serves as a strong incentive on Google’s part to make sure that Gmail treats its users well; Google is less likely to take actions that might lead to a rapid exodus. This is different than a fully proprietary platform such as Facebook or Twitter, where leaving those platforms means that you no longer are in communication in the same way with the people there and can no longer easily access their content and communications. With a system like Gmail, it is easy to export contacts and even legacy emails and simply begin again with a different service, without losing the ability to remain in contact with anyone.</p></blockquote>



<p>One key insight is with a diversity of platforms to choose from, and little cost from switching, as all your contacts come with you, platforms are incentivized to do good by their users lest they leave the site.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In addition, it opens up the competitive environment much more. Even as Gmail is an especially popular email service, others are able to build up significant email services—like Outlook.com or Yahoo Mail—or to create successful startup email services that target different markets and niches—like Zohomail or Protonmail.</p><p>Imagine a competing interface for Twitter that would be pre-set (and constantly updated) to moderate out content from trollish accounts, and to better promote more thoughtful, thought-provoking stories, rather than traditional clickbait hot takes. Or an interface could provide a better layout for conversations. Or for news reading.</p><p>A protocol system, by its very nature, would likely lead to much more innovation in this space, in part by allowing anyone to create an interface for accessing this content. That level of competition would almost certainly lead to various attempts to innovate, improving all aspects of the service. Competing services could offer a better filter, a better interface, better or different features, and much more.</p></blockquote>



<h2><a href="https://sriramk.com/bluesky-early" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlueSky Early Thoughts</a></h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Dorsey at Twitter recently announced BlueSky</a> the formation of a new team to build a decentralized social media protocol. Jack has realized this is the future of social media, and it would be beneficial to Twitter because they no longer need to be bastions of speech, they can kick undesirable users off their platform but not off the network, similar to email.</p>



<p>This is a great step in the right direction of where social media should go to unlock human creativity.</p>



<p>Sriram talks about the existing problem with social media platforms:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Imagine if Gmail was the only email client ever developed and SMTP+IMAP had never existed. Gmail could have defined all things email</p><p>But that is not where we find ourselves since SMTP <em>does</em> exist. These are open, documented standards which have evolved over years of open development.</p><p>Now, compare this with the current state of any social media product. You get a full “stack” &#8211; some of the most complex, intricate systems ever built in tech &#8211; which combines everything from relevance algorithms, content policies, verification policies, identity, incentive structures among many other things.</p></blockquote>



<p>So how can we build a better social network &#8211; through BlueSky&#8217;s proposal.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Alternate ranking models: every social platform uses a complex feed ranking algorithm optimizing for a combination of factors &#8211; community interaction, engagement, likelihood of spending time, etc. However as a customer you don’t get a choice of using different models. Imagine opening up any social platform and switching to a ranking that optimizes to show you only insightful content &#8211; or joyful content &#8211; or the most recent content. Or one that ranks content from people who typically don’t get attention. Or one that just shows you Keanu Reeves content. You can imagine a marketplace of “ranking models” and you get to plug and play any one.</p></blockquote>



<p>Being able to change your ranking algorithm would be game changing. Imagine if you could choose to only see content from your best friends, only see the best content in the last year instead of the last 2 days, only see stories that received positive feedback, ignore all political content etc. There are so many different ways to make our feed full of exactly the posts we want to see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This would lead to much more overall happiness, when we know we&#8217;re in control of what we read, instead of some AI algorithm optimized for engagement.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Alternate verification policies</p><p>Alternate content moderation policies</p></blockquote>



<p>Both extremely useful features to a social network, we can have many social network providers do verification, spam checks, block harassment etc, but all of the platforms can talk to one another and you can choose the community that suits you while still being able to connect and interact with those in other communities.</p>



<h2><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/05/meet-the-counterantidisintermediationists/527553/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Nomad Who’s Exploding the Internet Into Pieces</a></h2>



<p>Now for my favorite solution to decentralizing social media, a protocol known as Scuttlebutt. It&#8217;s free, open, and everything you&#8217;d hope for in a social protocol. There are already a number of clients running on Scuttlebutt which can talk to each other, but first let&#8217;s see what the man behind the machine has to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>For Tarr, the philosophical underpinning of Secure Scuttlebutt is social relativism. Because Scuttlebutt is distributed, each user decides what to do with their network and how to do it. This means that the users of SSB-driven software must consciously deliberate about whom they want to interact with “online,” and where, and why.</p><p>Commercial online services, by contrast, regulate user behavior with software and legal controls. Even the way users are identified on a service like Twitter, Instagram, or WhatsApp must conform with the service provider’s wishes. A username is a globally unique ID. Otherwise, how would the service and the users tell one individual from another?</p><p>Scuttlebutt doesn’t assume a replacement circumstance; instead it opens the door to many alternatives—the libertarians can have their markets, and the leftists can have their coops, and others can have anything in-between.</p></blockquote>



<p>By building a network with many clients, many platforms and many possible ways to experience your social world, it doesn&#8217;t matter what your desire, you can find the perfect platform and group for you. Or if it doesn&#8217;t exist, create your own.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Centralized services are easy to use, but they offer one-size-fits all solutions. Why should a social network for a school or a family or a neighborhood work the same way as one meant for corporate advertisers, or governmental officials, or journalists? Even if Scuttlebutt never catches on, it shows that the future online might be far more customized and diverse than the present. And not just in its appearance, like MySpace or GeoCities. But also in its functionality, its means of access, and its membership.</p></blockquote>



<h2><a href="https://jeremydormitzer.com/blog/what-is-activitypub.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is ActivityPub, and how will it change the internet?</a></h2>



<p>Another new decentralized social protocol I&#8217;m fascinated by but haven&#8217;t used much yet is ActivityPub. The biggest known social network using this protocol is Mastodon. Jeremy wrote this excellent piece explaining why it&#8217;s so exciting:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There’s a new social network in town. It’s called<a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Mastodon</a>. You might have even heard of it. On the surface, Mastodon feels a lot like Twitter: you post “toots” up to 500 characters; you follow other users who say interesting things; you can favorite a toot or re-post it to your own followers. But Mastodon is different from Twitter in some fundamental ways. </p><p>Mastodon isn’t controlled by a single corporation. Anyone can operate a Mastodon server, and users on any server can interact with users on any other Mastodon server.</p><p>This decentralized model is called federation. Email is a good analogy here: I can have a Gmail account and you can have an Outlook account, but we can still send mail to each other. In the same way, I can have an account on<a href="https://mastodon.technology/invite/JguyVqcL" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> mastodon.technology</a>, and you can have an account on<a href="https://mastodon.social/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> mastodon.social</a>, but we can still follow each other, like and re-post each other’s toots, and @mention each other. Just like Gmail servers know how to talk to Outlook servers, Mastodon servers know how to talk to other Mastodon servers (if you hear people talking about a Mastodon “instance”, they mean server). </p></blockquote>



<p>This federation is done via a new protocol called ActivityPub, which is an open source standard that different social networks and servers within a social network can use to talk to each other.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>ActivityPub is a social networking protocol. Think of it as a language that describes social networks: the nouns are users and posts, and the verbs are like, follow, share, create… ActivityPub gives applications a shared vocabulary that they can use to communicate with each other. If a server implements ActivityPub, it can publish posts that any other server that implements ActivityPub knows how to share, like and reply to. It can also share, like, or reply to posts from other servers that speak ActivityPub on behalf of its users.</p><p>ActivityPub is much bigger than just Mastodon, though. It’s a language that any application can implement. For example, there’s a YouTube clone called<a href="https://joinpeertube.org/en/faq/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> PeerTube</a> that also implements ActivityPub. Because it speaks the same language as Mastodon, a Mastodon user can follow a PeerTube user. If the PeerTube user posts a new video, it will show up in the Mastodon user’s feed. The Mastodon user can comment on the PeerTube video directly from Mastodon. Think about that for a second. Any app that implements ActivityPub becomes part of a massive social network, one that conserves user choice and tears down walled gardens. </p></blockquote>



<p>This protocol could be amazing! Tying together various sharing sites, social networks and content platforms into one cohesive social web.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Network effects” leaves kind of a dirty taste in my mouth. It’s usually used as a euphemism for “vendor lock-in”; the reason that Facebook became such a giant was that everyone needed to be on Facebook to participate in Facebook’s network. However, ActivityPub flips this equation on its head. As more platforms become ActivityPub compliant, it becomes more valuable for platforms implement ActivityPub: more apps means more users on the federated network, more posts to read and share, and more choice for users. This network effect discourages vendor lock-in. In the end, the users win.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is a powerful argument for why ActivityPub could eventually be the social standard online that even the current centralized platforms have to implement to keep up. I&#8217;m super excited to see how it develops and see new platforms adopt the protocol, making it continually more useful over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Fixing the closed social web</strong></p>



<p>Now that you understand the benefits of an open web, you&#8217;ll start to realize how dreary and restrictive the existing web is. Over time with enough fans, programmers and funding we can make this new decentralized web just as feature rich and populated as the existing social web. Then we&#8217;ll have a much brighter, more free social future for all of humanity now and into the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public social networks, comment sections, and discussion forums are broken. The internet promised limitless access to knowledge and thoughtful, intelligent conversations with people from all over the world. Instead, we have trolls, manipulators, outrage, and spam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It might seem like decentralization would make these problems worse. After all, most decentralized or unmoderated social networks turn into dumpster fires of low quality content over time. Without moderators or the threat of being banned, the worst users feel emboldened to spread their drivel across the entire network. As quality degrades, the best users are turned off and the network becomes less useful and engaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But there is a solution that gives power back to the people, allowing them to moderate their own world, working with friends to keep it free from low thought discourse. It works by mirroring the real world: give everyone a reputation and the ability to ignore those with a poor reputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article I&#8217;m going to show not only how a decentralized moderation system can be as good as existing systems, but also surpass them, creating a higher quality social network.</p>



<p>But first, let&#8217;s take a step back and see what centralized moderation gets wrong.</p>



<h3><strong>Centralized Moderation and its flaws</strong></h3>



<p>Centralized moderation refers to social networks or forums where one central entity, such as a corporation or the owner of the site, has sole moderation authority over the contents. There is usually one set of rules that all users must follow and if skirted the user’s content is deleted and repeat offenders are banned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flaws center around content that some users enjoy and others do not and how you deal with that content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With centralized moderation we all have to play by the same rules, so sites have to do the best job they can. If they are overly harsh in moderating they&#8217;ll have a good signal-to-noise ratio, but the content may become overly partisan or boring. If they&#8217;re too lenient the content will get noisier which makes it less enjoyable as there are then more low effort posts to sort through. And some of the worst content will turn many people off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Content Spectra</strong></h4>



<p>Imagine rating every piece of social media content along a content spectra of the following:</p>



<ul><li>Low Quality → High Quality</li><li>Low Offense →High Offense</li><li>Accurate → Inaccurate</li></ul>



<p>Consider where the content you enjoy most fits on these spectra. It’s likely not a fixed point, but rather a range of what is considered acceptable and a smaller range of what is considered ideal. </p>



<p>The worst content generally lies at the extreme of these spectra. Spam is extremely low quality, Haters are High Offense, and Manipulators are Frequently Inaccurate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, a site has a good signal-to-noise ratio when a good percent of the content falls into one’s ideal zone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users want to see content that falls into their ideal zone, rather than have to hear everyone’s opinion. If too much falls outside their ideal zone they&#8217;ll often become bored and leave the site.</p>



<p>Sometimes heavy moderation of content that falls outside of one’s “ideal zone” is a good thing, because it means you&#8217;ll enjoy the content you read more, without having to wade through purely acceptable content.</p>



<p>The central flaw of centralized networks is that by having a set of rules that all users must abide by, sites are presetting the allowable content spectra. This content spectra not only decides the kind of users that will be allowed on the site, but also those attracted to the site, because the users whose content spectra more closely match the website will tend to stick around more.</p>



<p>It turns out centralized services have thought about this problem over the past decade and have come up with a solution: algorithmically determined feeds. If everyone has their own feed, an AI algorithm can learn what one’s ideal content spectra is and show the content that most appeals to them. This feed is a filter on the world that helps one view the site in a curated “ideal” light.</p>



<p>Algorithmically determined feeds are the next stage in the evolution of social networks, but these feeds have their own set of problems.</p>



<h4><strong>The Algorithmically Chosen Feed Problem</strong></h4>



<p>Having a social feed driven by an algorithm can be useful for surfacing all the content you&#8217;d like to see most on a social network, but it also has dark sides that most rarely think about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest problem with utilizing algorithms to customize social feeds is that the user has no insight into the decisions the algorithm makes. With the rise of neural networks, at times even the developers of these algorithms are unable to explain their internal logic.</p>



<p>When a post is made, even one into which a lot of time and effort has been put, the algorithm may decide that it&#8217;s low quality, rank it lowly, and cause it to never appear in friends’ algorithmically chosen feeds. Under this paradigm, neither a user nor their friends’ opinions matter, the algorithm has decided and its decision is final.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, because these algorithms are applied to millions or even billions of people, there is a large financial incentive for manipulative companies or organizations to reverse engineer them. If they can figure out how these algorithms work, companies can tailor the algorithms to prioritize their own content to reach the top of as many feeds as possible. This becomes worse if the social network’s financial incentives are aligned with the company’s. Even if the social media network itself is completely benevolent, this will always be an issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One final flaw of these algorithms is the incentive for social networks to keep you hooked on their product. This means that the algorithms are optimized to display content you like and hide the content you don&#8217;t like. Though useful in moderation, this can quickly turn dangerous if optimized for dopamine hits and short term emotional appeal over mental health and well-being.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Who chose the moderators?</strong></h4>



<p>Centralized moderation has a fundamental, rarely discussed, issue: The idea that a third party is needed to moderate user’s content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why can&#8217;t we decide that for ourselves? Why do we have to be subject to the whims of covert moderators and opaque algorithms that decide who is allowed and what content is acceptable?</p>



<p>Decentralized worlds do not have to be structured in this way. Decentralized networks have the potential to fulfill the original intent of the internet: worlds open to everyone without global rulers in which everyone is able to participate and moderate their own domain. Users choose who to trust, who to ignore, and how one’s feed is ordered.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Solution: A Decentralized Moderation System that scales to everyone</strong></h3>



<p>To have the best social experience possible, moderation must be personalized. Individuals must be able to decide who can be a part of their world and who cannot. It&#8217;s not possible for any company to make policies that millions approve of and that do not have downsides and unintended consequences.</p>



<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that global moderators are no longer necessary. They are still incredibly useful, just no longer mandatory. Instead, moderators should be opt-in, leaving an individual, or group of individuals, to choose the moderator for one&#8217;s “world.”. This allows users to benefit from companies that specialize in detecting and eliminating spam, bot networks, or Astroturfing, without being forced to use them.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>How it works</strong></h4>



<p>In real life trust comes from friends and family, the people someone already trusts to help determine who can and cannot be trusted. When a friend begins to associate with bad people one either tries to steer them away or one’s trust in them falls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is exactly how the new decentralized trust system works. A user rates the trustworthiness of some of the people encountered online, and then trust of everyone else is calculated based on these ratings. In this implementation the trust ratings must be public, so that everyone can calculate the trust of friends of friends. In the future a more private trust system could be developed along similar lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second part is a filter that a user can apply to their social feed to hide everyone with a trust rating below a particular threshold.</p>



<p>Now this isn&#8217;t a finalized spec, it&#8217;s a rough outline of how this system can work. This essay is about why we should build this and how it could work, more than exact implementation details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To bootstrap the system the user would first give a rating to the people they trust/distrust on the network. These might be people known in real life or not. Ratings can be between -100 and 100. This rating should be how much a user trusts them to post content that is similar to their ideal content spectra, because these ratings will shape the content seen on the social network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a user encounters new people online they can give them +/- 1 votes based on individual pieces of content posted. For obvious spammers or trolls one could immediately give them a negative rating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, while individual pieces of content can be rated the trust rating is given to a person. This is because most people post content in a similar content spectra. However, it is important that trust is also linked to content so that when a user asks the question &#8220;Hey, why does my friend distrust this guy?&#8221;, they could see the exact piece of content that caused the distrust.</p>



<p>After a few trust ratings have been given, the algorithm will go on to calculate the trustworthiness of friends of friends (two degrees of separation away) and even their friends (three degrees away). It does this by taking all the people a user trusts and all the people they trust, then multiplying the trust levels together to come up with one’s own personal trust rating of everyone else. Even if a user only rates ten people, then those ten go on to rate ten others and those rate ten others, this will result in the user having trust ratings for over 1000 people on the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a trust rating is given it is fixed and not affected by the ratings of others. </p>



<p>The people a user distrusts have no effect on their trust rating of others. This is just like in real life, where when someone encounters someone they don’t like, they don&#8217;t care who their friends or enemies are. It also prevents malicious users from gaming the system. </p>



<p>Now instead of having to individually block spammers, trolls and haters from your world, as soon as a trusted friend rates someone poorly, they&#8217;ll be hidden automatically, making moderation of obvious trolls or spammers much easier.</p>



<h4><strong>The Algorithm</strong></h4>



<p>The general algorithm is: the trust rating of anyone who does not already have a set rating is the square root of how much a user trusts a mutual friend multiplied by how much the mutual friend trusts the stranger. In the case of negatives the negative is ignored when calculating the square root (so there&#8217;s no imaginary numbers). When a user has multiple mutual friends their scores are summed before the square root and that number is divided by total raters (so that someone who&#8217;s popular isn&#8217;t naturally more trusted).&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a small flaw with this algorithm. If a user has a friend Alice that is rated at a ten, and then they have a best friend Bob that is rated at 100, the score for bob will be (10)(100)= 31.6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is weird because the user doesn&#8217;t trust Alice that much, so why would they trust Bob more than her? We can make an improvement to address this: the trust level is capped to how highly the mutual friend has been rated.Similarly to real life, if an acquaintance brings a friend to a party, it doesn&#8217;t matter how much they say they like them, they still will not be trusted higher than that acquaintance.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a demo to showcase this system in action, with randomly generated users that randomly trust other users are random levels:</p>

<p>You can adjust the total users and average ratings per user to see how the system works as more people join in and use it. You can also adjust the depth, or degrees of separation, that the trust ratings are calculated for. </p>



<p>The arrows represent how much each user trusts the user the arrow is pointing to. The color of each user represents how much they are trusted by the selected user (the blue one), calculated via the algorithm described in this post. Bright green represents 100 trust and bright red -100 trust, with a gradient for scores in between.</p>



<p>The source code for this demo is <a href="https://github.com/adecentworld/decentralized-trust-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source on Github</a>. I&#8217;ve implemented a simple version of the trust algorithm in JavaScript which you can use for your own social network if you wish and it&#8217;s already fast enough for most use cases. </p>



<h4><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></h4>



<p>This can be implemented on top of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="/2020/03/what-is-scuttlebutt/" target="_blank">Scuttlebutt</a>, or any other open source social network. With Scuttlebutt the only requirement is a trust plugin which allows users to post trust-rating messages that contain a user/feed ID and their rating of that user. With that information, the algorithm can calculate the trust rating of all users based on the trust-rating messages everyone has posted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In regards to user experience, this plugin could add upvote/downvote buttons to each piece of content that increases or decreases trust in the user that posted that content. The trust filter can be a simple drop-down in the top right of the feed that, when a trust level is chosen, all posts by users with a trust rating below that level will be hidden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of performance, the demo above utilizes a simple algorithm in JavaScript, and even this is able to re-calculate the trust of 100,000+ people in just a few milliseconds. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/adecentralizedworld/decentralized-trust-demo#benchmarks" target="_blank">You can see the benchmarks here.</a></p>



<p>This can scale to hundreds of millions of users because each user only needs to calculate the ratings of a few hundred to tens of thousands of people. Because it&#8217;s open source this algorithm can be updated and improved over time if better ways of calculating trust are discovered. A written text example of this algorithm is in Appendix A.</p>



<h3><strong>Additional Benefits of Decentralized Trust</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Choose your own moderators</strong></h4>



<p>It&#8217;s still a good idea to have large organizations become moderators, because they have more resources and clout than individuals. The difference is, in a decentralized world, one can choose their own moderators. Imagine a future where the New York Times has their own &#8220;Trust Beacon&#8221; user on the platform. Whenever they report on fake news or fake content , this trust beacon can mark the content and those who post/create it at say -10 trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a user trusts the New York Times, they can rate it at say 50 trust, and it will apply it&#8217;s trust ratings to&nbsp; their social feed automatically. It&#8217;s the same as trusting any other user.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These trust beacons could be set up by any media companies, fake news catching websites, or even companies like NetNanny that want to filter out content unsafe for kids. People can trust anyone they like and then those trust ratings will be applied to their feed. This way a big network of friends is not needed to help filter content, these companies can do so if desired.</p>



<h4><strong>Trust can be linked to posts or images</strong></h4>



<p>This trust system doesn&#8217;t need to only apply to users. It can be applied to individual posts or pieces of content. For example, on Scuttlebutt every piece of media is stored as a blob, where the filename is a hash of it&#8217;s contents. This hash is essentially a fingerprint of image, video, song, etc. on the network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A trust beacon such as Snopes that debunks false information can have an account that flags images that are false. Because that image can be identified across the network by its hash, if a user subscribes to the Snopes trust beacon it can automatically flag and filter this content for them even if that image was reposted 100 times before they saw it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This could also be done with pornographic or violent content that&#8217;s unsafe for kids. Services such as NetNanny could maintain a list of these adult only images and videos and automatically block them for children, creating a safer space for them to explore than even the major networks can manage.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>You choose what trust means to you</strong></h4>



<p>The interesting thing about this system is that a user doesn&#8217;t have to trust people based on truthfulness. Trust is an arbitrary number that can be used to represent anything one would like to see more of in your social world. If a user wants trust ratings to be based on shared beliefs, positivity, or even geographical proximity that&#8217;s up to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine a world where instead of everyone having one social profile, they have one profile for every topic they’re interested in. One could have a profile for programming, for politics, for games, for decentralization, etc. If this becomes commonplace then one’s trust in someone can be directly related to their area of expertise. Trust is often not in the person but in one’s confidence that they know about whatever they&#8217;re talking about at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alternatively, it could be implemented in such a way that people have multiple trust ratings, each tagged by topic. However that would add a lot more complexity, especially around identifying what topic each post belongs to.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Creating Small Communities again</strong></h4>



<p>Most of the time friends are chosen through serendipity. <a href="https://legallysociable.com/2014/01/23/the-three-conditions-sociologists-say-are-crucial-for-friendship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It&#8217;s been shown that the secret to a friendship blooming is multiple random encounters.</a> One reason people rarely make friends via major social networks (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.) is because they are so large and spread out people rarely encounter the same person twice if they&#8217;re not already friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine if your social feed showed everyone you follow, as well as everyone they follow, with their rank based on trust ratings. You may discover some good friends of friends that you&#8217;ve never met posting content that you really like. Over time you could comment on their posts, contribute to the conversation, and, eventually, form a relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trust system would allow the best friends of friends to appear in user’s feed more often than a random crazy uncle, posts from groups, or even barely known acquaintances. This could lead to new connections and many amazing new friendships with people that were previously just out of contact. The more interests and people in common, the more users will see each other online and the more chances they’ll have to connect.</p>



<h4><strong>This is internet scale moderation</strong></h4>



<p>The future will be full of AIs and bots that create hundreds of thousands of accounts in order to take over social networks. With decentralized trust all it takes is one friend or trust beacon to notice these bots and distrust them. It needs to be possible to scale moderation to the level where it can combat thousands or even millions of fake users and bots. It can&#8217;t scale by having designated moderators, it can only scale if everyone participates in moderating some portion of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Downsides of Decentralized Trust</strong></h3>



<p>Now there are potential downsides to this system. As with anything, when&nbsp; people are given freedom some people are going to use it poorly. That&#8217;s okay. People shouldn’t be told what to do anyway.</p>



<p>The first obvious issue is the creation of echo chambers or online cults, where instead of choosing truth and seeking the best information, people trust those who confirm their existing beliefs.</p>



<p>This can be somewhat mitigated with the ability to set a trust filter level to a low level, even in the negatives, to see posts and opinions one may not usually be exposed to. This again is up to the end user if they wish to expose themselves to differing opinions or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is up to individuals to determine what&#8217;s best for them. Of course, one would hope they make good choices, but it is not society&#8217;s job to save people from themselves. It&#8217;s far better to have this freedom and the power to use or misuse it, than to allow companies to build the echo chamber behind closed doors.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The implementation will be open source and open to anyone to participate. Implementation has already begun, however there is a lot of work to do. If anyone has heard of anyone building something similar it would be wonderful to meet so this idea can be brought to fruition.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s exciting thinking about the possibilities this system would bring. There is potential for more stimulating conversation threads without trolls trying to ruin the fun. With the current state of the social internet this is hard, but it&#8217;s something worth doing.</p>



<h3><strong>Appendix A:</strong><br><strong>Trust system example</strong></h3>



<p>Lets walk through an example, starting with Tom.</p>



<ul><li>Tom has a best friend Alice, who he trusts at 100</li><li>Tom also has a friend Mike, who he trusts at 50</li><li>Alice knows a guy Dave, who&#8217;s a compulsive liar and trusts him at -20</li><li>Alice has a workmate Jeremy who&#8217;s an ok guy but she doesn&#8217;t know him well, so she trusts at 10.</li><li>Alice has a workmate Sophie, who constantly shares false outrage, but is otherwise a good person, who she trusts at -5.</li><li>Mike is best friends with Jeremy and trusts him 40</li><li>Mike knows Sophie and likes her, and trusts her 15</li><li>Dave has a best friend Barry, who he trusts 100</li><li>Sophie has a best friend Emily, who she trusts 100</li></ul>



<p>While Tom has only rated 3 people, the Trust Software will now calculate his personalized trust ratings for all 7 people here:</p>



<p>First there&#8217;s the immediate friends, if you&#8217;ve rated someone that is the fixed rating for them, it isn&#8217;t influenced by anyone else:</p>

<p>Then the tertiary friends:</p>



<p>Barry is unrated as Tom.Dave &lt; 0</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a few interesting things happening here. First, Sophie ends up with a slightly positive trust rating despite Tom&#8217;s best friend Alice saying she shares too much false outrage. This is because Mike still trusts her. If Tom notices that she does share a lot of false information he can either rate her himself which will mean his friends ratings no longer apply, or he can rate Mike lower because it&#8217;s becoming obvious Mike doesn&#8217;t care about truthfulness as much.</p>



<p>We also see that Barry&#8217;s rating is not calculated at all (so would default to 0). This is because if we don&#8217;t trust someone we also don&#8217;t trust anything they have to say about the reputation of others, so the system can&#8217;t be gamed by malicious actors.&nbsp; Similarly if Tom rated Sophie at a negative number then her rating of Emily would no longer apply and Emily would have the default rating of 0.</p>



<p>Lastly we see Emily&#8217;s rating is capped to the same rating as Tom.Sophie, because we never rate friends of friends higher than the mutual friend.</p>



<p>All the people above are now in a big discussion about politics and Tom can see this discussion happening in his feed. As Tom wants to be well informed without liars being involved he sets his trust filter level to 10, so everyone with less than 10 rating will be hidden. This allows Tom to filter his world without investing much effort in the process. In this feed he would only see posts from Alice, Mike, Jeremy and Emily. Posts from Sophie, Dave or Barry would be hidden.</p>
